# Set up a subscription service with Stripe Billing

This repository provides sample code for a complete integration with Stripe's Billing APIs to let you collect payments for subscription-based products or services. The samples are organized around the following use cases:

* Fixed-price subscriptions. You offer products or services with a single price for each item your customer subscribes to.

* Per-seat subscriptions. You offer products or services that your customer typically subscribes to more than one of, and the price to the customer depends on the quantity they purchase. This use case includes discounts for buying larger quantities.

* Usage-based subscriptions. You offer a service that your customer pays for depending on how much they use -- for example, EXAMPLE AND WE NEED EXAMPLES FOR ALL OF THEM. This use case includes discounts for higher usage volumes.
